Small rainclouds race through the sky as the sun emerges from behind the jungle canopy, illuminating the vibrant landscape.

A blond-haired &lt;span class=&#39;secretlink&#39;&gt; (link: &quot;French Canadian&quot;)[Québécois]&lt;/span&gt; man with a blue jacket and Capri pants admires the view from atop one particularly high foothill.

$v[&quot;Such a beautiful sight, isn&#39;t it?&quot;] He turns to face the camera. $v[&quot;We&#39;re here in the Andean mountains of Peru, right before the hills give way to the Amazon rainforest below and away. The crossroads of high and low, of wet and dry. And now, co-operation and competition.&quot;]

A shot of the challenge area is shown. There are walls enclosing an elevated plateau atop one foothill, with a single path leading in. Three banners flutter in the wind opposite the entrance – $q[one a dark indigo], $o[one a medium green], $c[and one a light pink].

$v[&quot;Here, 18 castaways from all walks of life will come to brave the elements, and each other, to see who is worthy of the title of Sole Survivor. They are playing here, in what was once part of the eastern edge of the great Inca Empire, which for a century was the most prominent civilization this side of the Atlantic. They succeeded without so many of the necessities that were taken for granted in the civilizations of Europe, Asia, and Africa... and this season&#39;s castaways are here to do the same.&quot;]



&#39;&#39;SURVIVOR: INCA LEGACY&#39;&#39;



$v[&quot;We have an exciting season planned for you all, with a number of secrets in store to keep both the players and you at home on your toes,&quot;] says Vincent. He smiles. $v[&quot;So without any further delay, let&#39;s get started. Eighteen castaways... 39 days... one Sole Survivor!&quot;]</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>
