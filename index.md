## About Me

I'm a guy in Canada. Early twenties. I write stuff, I draw stuff. This is where I intend to upload my Twine projects, and possibly my friends' projects, and possibly things that are not Twine-related.

~~I just don't want to use deviantArt to host my stuff.~~

## Projects

### Made in Twine 2

[Survivor: Inca Legacy](twine/incalegacyintro.html)

The third season of my not-a-hit Survivor fanfiction series. So far only the introduction is available.
