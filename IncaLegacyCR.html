Small rainclouds race through the sky as the sun emerges from behind the jungle canopy, illuminating the vibrant landscape.

A blond-haired &lt;span class=&#39;secretlink&#39;&gt; (link: &quot;French Canadian&quot;)[Québécois]&lt;/span&gt; man with a blue jacket and Capri pants admires the view from atop one particularly high foothill.

$v[&quot;Such a beautiful sight, isn&#39;t it?&quot;] He turns to face the camera. $v[&quot;We&#39;re here in the Andean mountains of Peru, right before the hills give way to the Amazon rainforest below and away. The crossroads of high and low, of wet and dry. And now, co-operation and competition.&quot;]

A shot of the challenge area is shown. There are walls enclosing an elevated plateau atop one foothill, with a single path leading in. Three banners flutter in the wind opposite the entrance – $q[one a dark indigo], $o[one a medium green], $c[and one a light pink].

$v[&quot;Here, 18 castaways from all walks of life will come to brave the elements, and each other, to see who is worthy of the title of Sole Survivor. They are playing here, in what was once part of the eastern edge of the great Inca Empire, which for a century was the most prominent civilization this side of the Atlantic. They succeeded without so many of the necessities that were taken for granted in the civilizations of Europe, Asia, and Africa... and this season&#39;s castaways are here to do the same.&quot;]



&#39;&#39;SURVIVOR: INCA LEGACY&#39;&#39;



$v[&quot;We have an exciting season planned for you all, with a number of secrets in store to keep both the players and you at home on your toes,&quot;] says Vincent. He smiles. $v[&quot;So without any further delay, let&#39;s get started. Eighteen castaways... 39 days... one Sole Survivor!&quot;]

&lt;span class=&#39;episode&#39;&gt;[[Cast Release]]&lt;/span&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Cast Release" tags="" position="612,486" size="100,100">(set: $crazy to (colour: #33ff33))
A young, blond-haired man wearing a buttoned blue jacket shuffled through some papers. He was sitting behind a desk with two empty chairs across from him. A folder in front of him had the label &quot;Profiles - 3&quot;.

$v[&quot;I think I have everything ready,&quot;] he said. He looked up to address the camera. $v[&quot;Viewers, I believe the third season is upon us. So, to help me show you all what you&#39;re in for, I&#39;ve brought in a special guest.&quot;] He looked behind the camera. $v[&quot;Come in!&quot;]

The camera swivelled so that the man was sitting on the left side of the screen. A TV screen was mounted to the wall now facing the camera. Another figure entered the view of the camera, this one with a humanoid body structure but otherwise resembling a gray cat. She was wearing a white and green baseball cap, a plain red t-shirt, and blue shorts. The tip of her tail dragged on the carpeted floor behind her as she walked casually to one of the empty chairs - now on the right side - and sat down.

&quot;Pleasure to be here again, Vincent,&quot; she said cheerfully.

$v[&quot;Pleasure to have you back,&quot;] Vincent replied. $v[&quot;In case you didn&#39;t know, I am Vincent Boucher, the host and associate producer of Survivor: Mint Version. Here with me today is Tipper Masterson, the sole survivor of our first season. She&#39;s here to help me comment on the cast for our third season.&quot;]

Tipper nodded. &quot;Inca Legacy, right?&quot;

$v[&quot;It is,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;Eighteen castaways in the highlands of eastern Peru. Not only are they fighting to survive in the wilderness, but they will be getting the tiniest glimpse of how some civilizations prospered in the exact same conditions.&quot;]

&quot;Wait a minute, will they be doing challenges or anything like that in actual native ruins?&quot; Tipper asked.

$v[&quot;We have a dynamic cast in store for you all,&quot;] Vincent said, ignoring Tipper, $v[&quot;and we&#39;ve prepared just enough surprises to keep both the players and the audience on their toes. Let&#39;s not waste any more time.&quot;]

&quot;You nailed that introduction,&quot; said Tipper. &quot;You didn&#39;t stumble over your words or miss something even once.&quot;

Vincent crumpled a piece of paper and tossed it at Tipper. It bounced off her nose and fell into her lap.

&quot;Hey, rude.&quot;

$v[&quot;You sure are.&quot;] Vincent smirked, and shook his head.

Quite suddenly the pair noticed a strange shade of green emanating from the wall. A loud bang was heard, and on the wall appeared a circular green wormhole.

Vincent looked nonchalantly at the wormhole. $v[&quot;You’ve got to be kidding me,&quot;] he sighed. $v[&quot;I thought I told him none of that wormholey sci-fi sh-&quot;]

Two figures exploded out of the wormhole, one wearing a purple buttoned up shirt with a matching cap and blue jean shorts. He lost his hat upon entering revealing a smooth head of no hair. His eyes darted back and forth, looking anxious after the experience.

The second figure appeared halfway out of the wormhole, grinning like a slasher villain and adorned with goggles over his eyes and blazing green hair.

$crazy[&quot;Hot diggity!&quot;] said the green clad lad. $crazy[&quot;That’s how you travel!&quot;]

The young bald man looked more annoyed than grateful as he brushed his hat. &quot;You know, I really think you need to stop assuming people enjoy traveling like that!&quot;

$crazy[&quot;Ahhh, c’mon!&quot;] said the green haired man. $crazy[&quot;You were running late. This was the only way to get you here on time!&quot;]

$v[&quot;He’s //my// guest, cRaZy,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;He has the address, there’s nothing wrong with him getting here on his own two feet.&quot;] He looked down at his desk. $v[&quot;And now my files are blown all across the room.&quot;]

The green man just shrugged his shoulders and shook his head. $crazy[&quot;Yeah, yeah, whatever.&quot;] He then turned and looked back up. $crazy[&quot;Say, I was gonna go get a slurpee! Does anyone want one?&quot;]

&quot;We’re GOOD, thanks.&quot; The purple kid groaned. &quot;I’ll call you when this is over!&quot;

$crazy[&quot;Suit yourself, buddy.&quot;] cRaZy bowed over-dramatically, then turned around and dove deeper into the vortex. The wormhole closed with a pants zipper sound.

&quot;Man, that guy is so strange...&quot; sighed the young man.

$v[&quot;Well, you’re here, Oliver, and that’s the important part.&quot;] Vincent gestured to the empty seat next to Tipper, before turning to the camera. $v[&quot;We also have Oliver Oreals here with us. He was the runner-up of last season, Survivor: Shuffle Island. Now, let&#39;s start off with the first castaway.&quot;]
The TV turned on, first displaying the season logo before switching to a picture of an attractive young woman with long blonde hair, vibrant green eyes, and a glowing smile. She was wearing a diamond necklace, and she appeared to be wearing a light pink top. (The photo did not show below her chest, which would reveal it to be a short dress.)

&#39;&#39;Ashleia Berns
thebigJET&#39;&#39;

$v[&quot;Ashleia is a model who has a strategy of being adaptable and independent,&quot;] said Vincent, $v[&quot;but she&#39;ll most likely have some trouble fitting in. See, she&#39;s a very wealthy person, and has been her whole life. She knows what to expect coming onto the show, but she&#39;s totally out of touch when it comes to what her tribemates see as necessities and luxuries. Ashleia will need to rely on her caring personality, and possibly her good looks, if she wants to be taken seriously.&quot;]

&quot;Hmm, I want to think she has a chance if she can remain on the positive side of things, but if she starts prattling on about needless things, I can see where that can get really old, really quick.&quot; Oliver said, stroking his chin.

&quot;I have a feeling she&#39;s going to come down with a bad case of foot-in-mouth disease,&quot; said Tipper. &quot;If she&#39;s as naive as she looks, she will undoubtedly rub at least someone the wrong way, and I won&#39;t be surprised if the &#39;she doesn&#39;t need the money&#39; card comes into play.&quot;

Vincent picked up a clicker on the desk and pushed the button. A picture of the next castaway appeared. He was a college-aged male with a round face, dark blond hair, and blue eyes. He was wearing a gray t-shirt bearing the name of his university in blue and white. He looked very serious.

&#39;&#39;Buddy McLeod
minty2mayhem&#39;&#39;

$v[&quot;Buddy has two sides to him. On the outside is a grumpy, cold, and defensive guy who only looks out for himself.&quot;] Vincent sighed. $v[&quot;But on the inside, Buddy is very sensitive and hates seeing others inflict pain. He&#39;s an idealist, and he vows that this season won&#39;t be as dark as the one you were on.&quot;] He looked at Tipper when he said this.

&quot;Those don&#39;t exactly sound like compatible personalities,&quot; said Tipper. &quot;At least he doesn&#39;t sound like a self-righteous and hypocritical hero. Those are not fun to watch get their way.&quot;

$v[&quot;Who says that his strategy is foolproof?&quot;] Vincent replied. $v[&quot;I can confidently say that this season is going to put Buddy&#39;s confidence to the test.&quot;]

&quot;I have been in a lot of pressure situations from ORGs and Survivor seasons myself,&quot; said Oliver. &quot;In one of my philosophy classes I remember hearing a quote that went like this: &#39;If thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee.&#39; Let&#39;s just hope he doesn&#39;t let his ideals lead him astray.&quot;

&quot;I have no idea what the relevance of that is, but okay,&quot; said Tipper.

Vincent hit the clicker button again. The next castaway was another college-aged person, this one a woman with tan skin and brown eyes, but bright blonde hair. She was wearing a long-sleeved, sky blue shirt. Her wavy, shoulder-length hair was brushed over her hairline in one direction, rather than parting in the middle.

&#39;&#39;Candace Breyer
minty2mayhem&#39;&#39;

&quot;Aww, she looks cute.&quot; Oliver smiled. &quot;I like her.&quot;

$v[&quot;Candace is something of a philosopher herself. She is very relaxed and approachable, and believes that to succeed in the game, she can&#39;t let anything get under her skin,&quot;] Vincent explained.

&quot;Oh, wow, I&#39;m yawning already,&quot; said Tipper.

$v[&quot;Save it,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;Her biggest struggle so far is that she&#39;s a recovering drug addict, and she feels that a change of lifestyle will be able to give her a new perspective on living a clean life.&quot;]

&quot;Leading a new lifestyle choice is one thing, going cold turkey into a reality show might have a whole load of repercussions that I really don&#39;t want to think about.&quot; Oliver gulped. &quot;If she can manage to somehow not let her past haunt her she might have a really incredible growth story... I&#39;ll root for her and hope for the best.&quot;

Vincent hit the clicker button, and when he saw the next person he nearly sighed. The next castaway was another young woman with long brown hair, a slim physique and light brown eyes. She had a short pink tee, and a beaming smile.

&#39;&#39;Denine Magro
minty2mayhem&#39;&#39;

$v[&quot;Ah, Denine, she has so much enthusiasm I don&#39;t know where to start for her,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;She seems really into being on the show and pulling off moves and having a good time... there&#39;s nobody that I can say is readier for the show than she is.&quot;]

&quot;Hopefully she does more than just spout trivia the whole time,&quot; said Tipper, picking up a paperclip, &quot;or this is going straight into my eyeball.&quot;

&quot;Hmm...&quot; Oliver said, leaning into the image to inspect it carefully. &quot;I don&#39;t know about her. Being a fan of a show is one thing, being OUT THERE is a whole other kettle of fish entirely. I will say she probably won&#39;t last very long.&quot;

$v[&quot;The two of you are both only really seeing one side of her fan status,&quot;] Vincent replied. $v[&quot;There&#39;s more to her than that, but I would like to leave that as a surprise for now.&quot;]

&quot;Well I hope she proves me wrong then, because right now I have doubts.&quot; Oliver shrugged.

Vincent smiled, and clicked his clicker. The next castaway was yet another young woman, this one with long, bright blonde hair and green eyes. She was wearing a red and black plaid jacket, and she looked smug.

&#39;&#39;Jackie Potato
meme12rose&#39;&#39;

&quot;She looks familiar,&quot; said Tipper.

$v[&quot;I was wondering if you would notice,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;This is Jackie, the twin sister of Emily from your season. Like her sister, she is stubborn and cliquey, but that is about where the similarities end.&quot;]

&quot;Oh wow, a sibling on a new season?&quot; said Oliver, intrigued. &quot;I always like to compare and contrast relatives when they play on separate seasons.&quot;

$v[&quot;Putting them on the same season would be too cliché if you ask me,&quot;] Vincent replied. $v[&quot;Jackie prides herself on her strategic ability and is willing to do anything to get to the end. She&#39;s totally willing to be labeled the villain if it means she&#39;s playing the game right. I even remember her saying &#39;my game is going to be Inca Legacy, not Emily&#39;s Legacy.&#39;&quot;]

&quot;Hmmm...&quot; Oliver said after hearing that statement. &quot;I mean confidence can take people only SO FAR. I would hope she isn&#39;t all bark, but with a statement like that now I am starting to get early boot vibes from her.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m about confident she&#39;s going to shoot herself in the foot somewhere along the line. There&#39;s no way that she doesn&#39;t have at least something in common with Emily,&quot; said Tipper.

&quot;I agree.&quot; Oliver nodded.

Vincent chuckled, and pressed the button on his clicker. The next castaway was a fairly young man with dark skin and short black hair. He was wearing a red and white sports jersey, and he looked slightly surprised.

&#39;&#39;Jarrett Wayne
minty2mayhem&#39;&#39;

$v[&quot;Jarrett is a very blunt man, and he&#39;s not afraid to speak for his allies,&quot;] Vincent explained. $v[&quot;He doesn&#39;t like to bend to other people&#39;s wills, and he is determined to be an influential person himself.&quot;]

&quot;So, will he be trying to step up and lead, or does he just not want to be told what to do?&quot; Tipper asked. &quot;Depending on what his tribe pans out to be, one of those strategies will work out for him and the other one spells early boot.&quot;

&quot;I do see potential in him becoming a force of nature on his team,&quot; said Oliver, &quot;the question is will he be one of good or bad. I will say he&#39;s probably going to lean more on the antagonistic than the heroic.&quot;

Vincent shrugged and pressed the button on his clicker. The next castaway was a college-aged woman with medium-length brown hair and dark brown eyes. Her hair was mostly brushed over to her left side. She was wearing a denim jacket over a white undershirt, and she was smirking in her picture.

&#39;&#39;Jennifer Prince
minty2mayhem&#39;&#39;

$v[&quot;Jennifer doesn&#39;t take crap from anyone,&quot;] Vincent explained. $v[&quot;She&#39;s a wannabe leader who doesn&#39;t like conflict, but she&#39;s aware of her team dynamics. She will act for the good of her tribe, but she doesn&#39;t always see how strong she comes across.&quot;]

&quot;If I had any advice for her, it&#39;d be to pull back on the reins a little bit,&quot; Oliver pointed out. &quot;No one likes to be babysat, even if said watcher had good intentions. I think she might accidentally cause the powder keg to blow if she doesn&#39;t pick her battles correctly.&quot;

&quot;Who&#39;s to say her intentions are any good?&quot; Tipper replied. &quot;The good of the tribe isn&#39;t always the best way to go. You shouldn&#39;t be afraid to take a stand against the authority if said authority is a pile of garbage.&quot;

$v[&quot;Still bitter, are we?&quot;] Vincent asked, smirking a little.

Oliver just shuddered.

Vincent pressed the button on his clicker. The next castaway was wearing an indigo hood, and something with a brown strap. The whites of his black eyes were visible, but not even the profile of his face could be distinguished from the shadow underneath his hood.

&#39;&#39;Khall
SSBFreak&#39;&#39;

&quot;That might be the goofiest ninja I have ever seen.&quot; Oliver snickered at the big eyed hooded figure.

$v[&quot;How did you know he was- nevermind.&quot;] Vincent shook his head. $v[&quot;This is Khall... he&#39;s a bit of a goofball. He&#39;s very physically adept, but most of the time he just fails to get that across, so he looks more like a liability than an asset. He&#39;s not the sharpest tool in the shed, and he has an affinity for standing on inappropriately located flora and babbling about story conventions.&quot;]

&quot;I can&#39;t think of anything to say here, but...&quot; Tipper held her head in utter confusion.

&quot;As much fun as his personality might be, I am going to assume his unpredictable nature might just rub too many people the wrong way. As fun as it would be to see him bouncing around the place I don&#39;t see him lasting very long unfortunately.&quot; Oliver sighed.

Vincent clicked his clicker, revealing the next castaway: a young woman with platinum blonde hair, bright blue eyes, and a sweet smile. She was wearing a light blue top with spaghetti straps.

&#39;&#39;Lisa Peters
minty2mayhem&#39;&#39;

$v[&quot;Lisa is a very kind and respectful person, and she wants to prove that it&#39;s possible to win without making enemies,&quot;] Vincent explained. $v[&quot;She may appear to be a naive and innocent angel, but she is not afraid to take matters into her own hands and tell people what she wants them to do.&quot;]

&quot;I like her too,&quot; said Oliver. &quot;I find her spunky and she probably has the potential to be a real heroine of the season. I hope she can last long enough to see it through.&quot;

&quot;At least she&#39;s not expecting to get by on being pretty and non-threatening,&quot; said Tipper. &quot;If you&#39;re going to get on the show, at least try and play.&quot;

Vincent nodded. $v[&quot;Exactly.&quot;] He pressed his clicker and the next castaway appeared. This one was the first nonhuman of the cast, a pudgy anthropomorphic otter. He had dark brown eyes, a black and white visor, and an open blue jacket. His expression was a neutral one, as if he was getting a driver&#39;s license.

&#39;&#39;Louie Leingartner
minty2mayhem&#39;&#39;

$v[&quot;Louie may be a chubby surfing otter, three traits that correspond to cheerfulness, but Louie is not that,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;He&#39;s a very determined and stoic guy who finds himself most comfortable in a competitive environment. Arguably, his physical ability will be what determines whether he will go down swinging or make a real impact on the game.&quot;]

&quot;It&#39;s strange... I mean I can tell this guy has a story to tell, but I bet it will be something unexpected.&quot; Oliver rubbed his chin in thought. &quot;I can see him be a breakout hero or villain this season, and in both camps I can see him playing either role really well. He&#39;s my dark horse pick for the win regardless of any alignment he fills out.&quot;

Tipper scratched the back of her head. &quot;He looks like the kind of guy who will fulfill the carefree stereotype to your face, and then backstab you for the most minor infraction. I hope for his sake that nobody pushes him to that point.&quot;

&quot;Bad experience with otters too?&quot; asked Oliver with a hint of sarcasm.

&quot;Wait until a panther comes up, then we&#39;ll talk,&quot; Tipper snapped.

&quot;....&quot; Oliver went deadpan and glared at the screen with his arms crossed. &quot;NEXT PLEASE!&quot;

Vincent rolled his eyes and pressed the clicker button. The next castaway was a young woman of Korean descent. She had brown eyes with glasses, black shoulder-length hair, and a green clip in her hair. She was wearing a dark yellow shirt, and she was smiling slightly.

&#39;&#39;Min-Ji Han
minty2mayhem&#39;&#39;

$v[&quot;Min-Ji claims that she&#39;s a natural born leader, and she wants to keep her tribe focused and organized,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;Unlike many so-called leaders, she knows her tribe won&#39;t necessarily be a functioning unit, and she&#39;s willing to jump into the fold of tribe politics to make moves that interest only her, and then make sure what&#39;s left can bounce back.&quot;]

&quot;She&#39;s a realist.&quot; Oliver pointed out. &quot;Having the foresight of knowing when to fight and who to fight alongside can be a crucial advantage for some players. I bet she&#39;ll have a solid couple of rounds, but if people start to catch on she&#39;ll be in for some rough waters ahead. I&#39;ll root for her though because it&#39;s nice to see someone who is going to stick to their guns as opposed to folding to another&#39;s demands.&quot;

&quot;I figure she might be able to go the distance if she distinguishes team leader Min-Ji from game player Min-Ji,&quot; said Tipper. &quot;Might be more difficult than I make it sound.&quot;

Vincent nodded and pressed the clicker button. The next castaway was certainly the oldest so far - a man who looked to be in his early fifties or so, with short, graying hair and blue eyes. He had an overweight build and a dull green buttoned jacket.

&#39;&#39;Monty
CKD&#39;&#39;

$v[&quot;Monty is probably one of my favourites in the cast,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;He&#39;s a good-natured Southern construction worker who wants to try something different and learn about himself. He&#39;s not going to worry himself much with strategy, he&#39;s just out here to make some good relationships and have some good stories to tell his pals back home.&quot;]

&quot;I don&#39;t see him going far enough in running challenges, let alone in the competition,&quot; said Tipper. &quot;I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll have a great week or two in Peru, though.&quot;

&quot;Contrary to my associate, I have high hopes for Monty.&quot; Oliver grinned. &quot;An older guy with a easy going nature might just be what his tribe needs to stay sane. I mean, will it get him a win? I can believe he has the skills and personality to make a very solid end game resume among his peers. I think he&#39;s also in my top four to win.&quot;

&quot;I think his fellow competitors will be more like his kids&#39; peers than his own,&quot; said Tipper.

&quot;How did you win your season again?&quot; Oliver rubbed his temples.

Vincent sighed and pressed the button on his clicker. The next contestant was a college-aged woman with wavy black hair and brown eyes. She had a tan skin colour that suggested she was of Hispanic descent. She was wearing a green t-shirt, and she had a calm smile.

&#39;&#39;Paula Cortes
minty2mayhem&#39;&#39;

$v[&quot;Paula has a good head on her shoulders, but other than that I don&#39;t even think she knows what she&#39;s going to do,&quot;] said Vincent, stifling a laugh. $v[&quot;She says that she&#39;s going to assess everyone and try to play an intelligent game, but she has trouble under pressure. She could do well if she isn&#39;t caught off guard, I think.&quot;]

&quot;I&#39;m cool with that, as long as it doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;s going to dominate this season and play everyone like a fiddle,&quot; said Tipper. &quot;For our sake, I hope she runs into something unexpected that throws her off and shakes up her game.&quot;

&quot;I mean she seems to have an idea how to play the game, but if her anxiety is really that big of a deal then her biggest obstacle will probably be herself,&quot; Oliver pointed out. &quot;If any conflict should arise from this season, most likely she&#39;ll be the one who inadvertently starts it.&quot;

Vincent nodded and clicked his clicker. The next castaway was a light-skinned young man with blond hair slicked back, and green eyes. He was wearing a blue and purple plaid shirt that looked a bit too wide for him. He looked contemplative.

&#39;&#39;Rhett Mason
DoctorRoy&#39;&#39;

&quot;I can appreciate a man in purple.&quot; Oliver smirked.

$v[&quot;Rhett is a cool, collected young man who thrives in social situations,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;He&#39;s a fan of debate, and he thinks that deep discussions are the best way to get to know a person&#39;s true character. If he can&#39;t do that, then he has trouble trusting them.&quot;]

&quot;I think he has potential to be a schemer of the season.&quot; Oliver said. &quot;I also get the impression that if he were to get a vote thrown at him, he might go on a witch hunt. I just hope he&#39;s not unbearable out there if he really focuses on debating about morality and trust all the time.&quot;

&quot;He looks like a wannabe used car salesman,&quot; said Tipper. &quot;You start out talking about where to build the shelter, and before you know it you&#39;re in a final two alliance and you&#39;re $50,000 in debt.&quot;

$v[&quot;There&#39;s a story there,&quot;] said Vincent. He pressed the button on his clicker. The next contestant was an anthro skunk wearing sunglasses and a black leather jacket over a red shirt. He appeared to be really annoyed about something.

&#39;&#39;Rocky
Tinyhammer&#39;&#39;

&quot;Say, Oliver, you&#39;re not going to be bitter about skunks too, are you?&quot; Tipper asked, half curious and half waiting for a reaction.

&quot;Only if they tie me to a pole and beat me.&quot; Oliver said not even looking at Tipper.

$v[&quot;We are NOT talking about that,&quot;] Vincent snapped. $v[&quot;Despite being about the same age as most of his competitors, Rocky here is very entitled and immature guy. His hobbies include partying, rock music, and booze. He picks fights with pretty much anyone, and he doesn&#39;t care what people think of him as long as he gets what he wants.&quot;]

&quot;Oh, he sounds like a saint.&quot; Oliver shook his head. &quot;The sooner his torch is snuffed the better.&quot;

&quot;I think I&#39;m in love,&quot; sighed Tipper. &quot;If there&#39;s a brain under there, I&#39;ll hope that he goes far and plays with people, just so everyone loses it when they don&#39;t see it coming.&quot;

&quot;Well I know a guy from Philly you might get along with if this falls through.&quot; Oliver chuckled.

&quot;I hope you&#39;re not talking about that living pit stain you call Brody,&quot; Tipper groaned.

&quot;Him? Of course not!&quot; Oliver then looked to Vincent and mouthed //&quot;I am totally talking about that guy!&quot;//

Vincent decided not to entertain this bitter feud and moved on to the next contestant. She was a young anthro rabbit with gray fur and dark green eyes. She was wearing a black t-shirt with a white outline of two dice on it. She was smiling brightly.

&#39;&#39;Tara Grey
minty2mayhem&#39;&#39;

$v[&quot;Tara is a friendly, outgoing girl who likes to show off,&quot;] explained Vincent. $v[&quot;Her hobby is magic, and she hopes that she can impress her team to help form initial relationships with them. She knows she&#39;s not the strongest player, but she wants to make up for it in charisma and a little sass.&quot;]

&quot;I have a feeling she&#39;s going to be the underdog type who gets by through being a positive force on her team that everyone wants to be friends with,&quot; Tipper suggested. &quot;I don&#39;t know if she&#39;ll able to avoid being seen as dangerous if she depends on this strategy too much.&quot;

&quot;The only way I can see someone so positive getting eliminated early is if she&#39;s on a tribe of complete jerks.&quot; Oliver nodded. &quot;I am hoping that isn&#39;t the case because I am sure she can be a really rootable player if she can make it far enough… yes she&#39;s also a top contender for me.&quot; he smiled.

$v[&quot;And that brings us to the last contestant of the season,&quot;] said Vincent. He pressed the button on his clicker, and the TV screen flashed red.

&quot;Wait, what&#39;s happening?&quot; Tipper asked.

&quot;Oh god....&quot; Oliver stood up from his chair looking hella scared right now.

$v[&quot;That&#39;s weird,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;This calls for some percussive maintenance.&quot;] He stood up from his chair, walked over to the T$v[ and smacked it once with the clicker.

The screen returned to its normal colours, but the final castaway was only a black silhouette...

...but it cleared up to reveal a man in his mid-twenties with short brown hair, glasses, and a five o&#39;clock shadow. He was wearing a bright blue shirt, and his green eyes showed how anxious he was.

&#39;&#39;Václav Beránek
minty2mayhem&#39;&#39;

&quot;Oh, thank goodness...&quot; Oliver sighed in relief. &quot;Just some kid who looks like he wet himself.&quot;

$v[&quot;Oliver, sit down,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;Václav is an intelligent man who sometimes gets caught up in his ideas, good or bad. He says he is prepared for the strategic aspect of the game, but he has to be wary of his tendency to overthink things, but my worry is that he&#39;s going to be more concerned of literally everything else. Václav might be a huge threat if he would just take a deep breath once in awhile.&quot;]

&quot;Looks like he&#39;s going to be a complete disaster,&quot; said Tipper. &quot;However, where he differs from Sly is that Václav looks like he has a backbone, so he isn&#39;t doomed to goat status, and might even get targeted for simply having a good day.&quot;

&quot;Well now I feel bad for saying that aboot him.&quot; Oliver frowned. &quot;I hope he does manage to find his way in this crazy game somehow, and if he doesn&#39;t win I hope he can at the very least grow from the experience.&quot;

Vincent clicked his clicker one last time, revealing the cast of 18 sitting and standing on the steps of what appeared to be a temple of some kind.

$v[&quot;So, any thoughts, questions, concerns?&quot;] said Vincent.

&quot;Yeah, are these actual ancient ruins or just props?&quot; Tipper asked. &quot;I really hope you guys aren&#39;t romping around in places with historical and archaeological value.&quot;

$v[&quot;No comment. Oliver, any questions?&quot;] Vincent asked, slightly annoyed.

&quot;A few, will there be any special gimmicks, twists, advantages distributed this season?&quot; asked the purple clad Canadian.

$v[&quot;Actually yes,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;Right out the gate, each tribe is presented with a choice that will have an impact on whether their tribe is truly successful. We&#39;re also bringing back two big twists to make this game a truly hectic experience - kidnapping, and One World. We even have another twist that wasn&#39;t even planned by production!&quot;]

&quot;Wow.&quot; Oliver said, his interest piqued. &quot;I look forward to see what kind of shake ups you have in store for this season.&quot; He gave a thumbs-up.

&quot;What is this twist you didn&#39;t plan?&quot; Tipper asked.

$v[&quot;If we told you, then it wouldn&#39;t be as surprising to you as it was to us,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;You&#39;ll have to wait and see. Anything else you wanted to ask?&quot;]

&quot;Yes, when will this season commence?&quot; Oliver said, looking back up at the full cast picture.

Vincent shrugged.

&quot;Well then, let&#39;s see how it plays out! I am eager to see how the game goes!&quot; Oliver nodded in approval.

&quot;Yeah, me too, surprisingly enough,&quot; said Tipper.

$v[&quot;That&#39;s good to hear, I&#39;m glad that you&#39;re on board,&quot;] Vincent said, smiling. $v[&quot;Thanks for coming out, guys, I appreciate it.&quot;]

&quot;Anytime,&quot; said Tipper. Oliver nodded in agreement.

$v[&quot;Well, hopefully you at home will enjoy the season as well,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;You know what they say, third time&#39;s the charm, right?]

&#39;&#39;An Hour Later&#39;&#39;

The TV was off, as were all the lights. The room was completely empty, as Vincent had returned to his office, and Tipper and Oliver had headed home.

A green wormhole materialized on the wall, and with a loud boom, a familiar-looking man in green stepped out holding a tray of four coloured drinks.

$crazy[&quot;I got everyone slurpees!&quot;] cRaZy exclaimed. $crazy[&quot;I know you said you didn&#39;t want any, but deep down I knew-&quot;]

He realized he was alone in the room, and his face immediately dropped.
